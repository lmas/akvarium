A tiny aquarium running a [Boids] simulation.

Using only three simple rules one is able to simulate emergent flocking behaviour.
The three rules are:

![rules]

- **Cohesion:** A single Boid tries to move towards the center of a nearby group of other Boids.
- **Alignment:** And it should try to match it's velocity and direction with it's neighbours.
- **Separation:** While moving, it should also try to avoid collisions with the closest neighbours.

This results in a group movement that resembles flocks of birds or schools of fish,
mimicking real life pretty convincingly.
A quick demonstration with clown fish:

## Usage

Download the source and then run the main simulation with:

    go run main.go

Or, if you have installed [just], you can simply run it with:

    just run

Running the tests:

    just test

Running all benchmarks for a package:

    just bench boids

Running a specific benchmark inside a package:

    just benchtest=Vectors bench boids

And showing all other shortcut commands:

    just



## FAQ

## Why?

For fun. And I wanted a pretty recreational project to tinker with slowly over time.

### What's the performance like?

Running on my mid-range laptop with an Intel i5-7200U CPU,
I'm able to simulate 10 000 Boids (and 100 goroutine workers) at 60 Â± 1 FPS.

Running the benchmark (using 1000 Boids and 10 workers on commit [ce5397c]) I get:

```
# just benchtest=Boids bench boids
go test -bench "Boids" -benchtime 5s -benchmem ...
goos: freebsd
goarch: amd64
pkg: github.com/lmas/akvarium/boids
cpu: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-7200U CPU @ 2.50GHz
BenchmarkBoids-4   	    2071	   2737401 ns/op	   12814 B/op	       7 allocs/op
PASS
ok  	github.com/lmas/akvarium/boids	6.167s
```

It's not that great, so I'm open to suggestions.

### Any issues?

- FPS seems to drop when the main window loses focus.
- Can't easily show video clips on Github, so without ext. hosting we're limited to giant GIFs.



## Roadmap

In rough order of importance.

### Phase One

- Public release and feedback.
- Finish documentation and add the last tests.

### Phase Two

- Add simple entities, moving in the distant background; couple of whales, a giant sunfish.
- Add static environment for back- and foreground; prerendered corals, rocks and cliffs[^1].
- Add shader to simulate some kind of distance blur/dim for background objects.

### Phase Three

- Add camera controls (zoom and pan), so the aquarium can increase in volume.
- Add more entities; floating jellyfish, shrimp, feeding anemones, swaying kelp stalks.
- Replace the school of clownfish; herring seems more appropriate?
- Add animation; all entities should render a couple of frames.
- Add shader to simulate shimmering fish scales.

### Phase Four

- Add passage of time and a colour/light glow shader.
- Investigate randomly generating environment[^2], such as corals and rocks.
- Add underwater sounds?
- Add some form of user interaction (and saving state); feeding fish?
- Render the simulation in ASCII for terminals?
- Replace the geospatial index with something else?

### Phase Five

- Release v1.0.
